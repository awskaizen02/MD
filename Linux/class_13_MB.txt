OS- Linux 
 
 
  IS open source
  	–Code is publicly available,and users can modify and expand it
  
  •Supports multiple users and multi-tasking
  •Is built to handle networking
  •Provides system tools and utilities

Kernel
	Provides the core functionality of the operating system

	The kernel refers to the core component of an operatingsystem. 
	It controls everything in the operating system, including the allocation of CPU time and memory storage to running programs, and access to peripheral devices.
	
	The Linux kernel manages the running of multiple applications and the sharing of resources among multiple users. It also controls the interface to the input/output (I/O) devices that are connected to the computer, and it manages files and directories.

Daemons
	Provide extra support for the system or the user
	
	A daemon is computer program that runs in the background and is not under the control of an interactive user. It typically provides a service to other running programs.
	
	Examples of daemons include the following:
	•syslogd: When system or user applications generate messages, the syslogddaemon captures the messages and stores them to a file, which is called a log.
	•sshd: The sshddaemon handles Secure Shell (SSH) connections to the computer. This type of connection uses encryption to secure the communication between the client and the server
	
Applications
	Include programs such as text editors, web browsers, and databases
	
	An application, is a computer program that provides functions that help users perform a type of task or activity. 
	For example, with a word processor app, users can create and edit text content, and this type of app facilitates document authoring and modification. 
	Likewise, with a web browser app, userscan access the internet and visit websites.
	
Data files
	Include user content such as text files, music files, and image files
Configuration files
	Contain settings for Linux, services, and applications that are stored in text files
	
	
to access Lnux machine using ssh method

puttygen  => helps to convert .pem to .ppk format
putty  	  => support only .ppk format
terminal  => can use .pem key format


security group
	ssh	= allow to access linux machine
	rdp	= allow to access windows machine
	http	= allow to access internet
	https	= allow to access internet with secure (certificate)
	
	
transfer the data from windows to linux => winscp
