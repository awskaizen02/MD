You will learn how to:
	•Identify other types of communication protocols
	•Describe common transport, application, and network management protocols
	•Use tools to discover information about network communications
	
	
A communication protocol isa system of rules. 
These rules permit two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information throughany variation of a physical quantity.
The different types of communication protocols include transport, application, management, and support protocols. Transport protocols run over the best-effort IP layer to provide a mechanism for applications to communicate with each other. 
The two general types of transport protocols are a connectionless protocol (User Datagram Protocol) and a 
connection-oriented protocol (Transmission Control Protocol).
Application protocols govern various processes, from downloading a webpage to sending an email. 
Examples include HTTP, SSL, TLS, mail protocols (SMTP, POP, and IMAP), and remote desktop protocols (RDP and SSH).
Management protocols are used to configure and maintain network equipment. Support protocols facilitate and improve network communications	


In the OSI model, the protocol layer above the internet layer is the transport layer.
The two most important protocols in the transport layer are TCP and UDP. 
TCP provides reliable data delivery service with end-to-end error detection and correction, and
UDP provides low-overhead, connectionless datagram delivery service. 
Both protocols deliver data between the application layer and the internet layer.


Why is this information important for issues and troubleshooting?
	Because TCP and UDP use ports for communication, most layer 4 transport problems revolve around ports being blocked. 
	When troubleshooting layer 4 communications issues, first make sure that no access lists or firewalls are blocking TCP/UPD ports.  
	Remember that the transport layer controls the reliability of any given link through flow control, segmentation and desegmentation, and error control. 
	Some protocols can keep track of the segments and retransmit the ones that fail. 
	The transport layer acknowledges successful data transmission and sends the next data if no errors have occurred. 
	The transport layer creates packets from the data that it receives from the upper layers.

TCP/IP is aconnection-oriented protocol. 
It defines how to establish and maintain network communications where application programs can exchange data. 
Data that is sent through this protocol is divided into smaller chunks calledpackets.	

The goal of TCP/IP was to support an interconnection of networks, which was referred to as aninternetwork, orinternet. The internet comprises the groups of networks that communicate over this protocol.
In terms of the OSI model, TCP is a transport-layer protocol. 
It provides reliable virtual-circuit connection between applications; that is, a connection is established before data transmission begins. 
Data is sent without errors or duplication and is received in the same order as it is sent. 
No boundaries are imposed on the data; TCP treats the data as a stream of bytes

HTTP is the protocol that is used to reach webpages. A full HTTP address is expressed as a uniform resource locator (URL).
Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) is a combination of HTTP with the SSL/TLS protoco

tracert - traceroute  = is a command that shows the path your data takes to reach another computer or website o the internet

•ping tests connectivity. 
	This tool tests whether the remote device (server or desktop) is on the network.
•nslookup queries the DNS and its servers. 
	It shows the IP addresses that are associated with a given domain name.
•traceroute permits users to see the networking path that is used. 
	It is helpful for troubleshooting connectivity problems.
•telnet is used for service response. 
	This tool tests whether the service that runs on the remote device is responding to requests
