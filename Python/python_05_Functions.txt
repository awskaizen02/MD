Functions:

	•Explain the purpose of functions
	•Name the different types of functions
	•Use functions to organize Python code

A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task
you can defin it once and use it many times, which makes your code cleaner and easier to maintain

def greet():
	print("Hello Python")

def 	-> keyword to define a function
greet	-> name of the function
()	-> parentheses (may contain parameters)	


In Python, afunctionis a named sequence of statements that belong together. 
Their primary purpose is to help organize programs into chunks that match how youthink about the solution to the problem

First, define the function.Name it and put place holders for arguments. 
Indent lines of code inside the function, like code in loops.

Built-in functions (like print) are part of a programming language, or developers can create new functions.

Python has many built-in functions that solve many common problems for you.
Examples:
	•print()	# Display output
	•open()		# Opens a file
	•sum()		# Adds items in a list/tuple
	•dict()		# Create a dictionary
	•len()		# Gives the length of a string or list
	•type()		# shows the type of a variable
	•input()	# reads user input
	
	
Types of functions:-
Types of Python functions
No argument taken, returns something (fruitful)
No argument taken, no return given 
Takes argument or arguments, returns something (fruitful)
Takes argument or arguments, no return given
	

•What is the identifier (name of this function)?
•What is the argument?
•What is it returning?
•Is this function fruitful or non-fruitful?


def demo(x):
     y = x + 3
     return  y
print(demo(7))  

* in demo taht takes one parameter x
* inside the function:- it calculates y = x+3
* returns y = 7 + 3 = 10

On the print line, multiple things are happening:
•The function demo is being called. Functions do not run until you call them. 
•The print function is also being called, and it uses demo as the argument for print(). 
It can be helpful to call a function with another function.
•What output do you expect to be printed?



def add(a, b):
    return a + b
    
test = add(8, 2) 
print(test)


def multiple(a,b):
    return a * b
    
t1 = multiple(8,2)    
print(t1)

-------------------------
•Is this function fruitful or non-fruitful?
•When you run this function, what do you expect to happen?
•What might be some of the advantages of using an argument in a function?

a = 3
b = 2
c = 1
def demo():
     y = (a+b+c)
demo

---

a = 3
b = 2
c = 1
def demo():
     y = (a+b+c)
     print(y)
demo()

Organizing code with functions 

Organizing code with functions makes it easier to read.
Example:
	•It can be difficult to interpret what the first line of code does.
	•Using an appropriately named function that takes appropriately named arguments makes the code easier to interpret and use
	
Easier to read
	Functions let you give a meaningful name to a lock of code
Easier to maintain
	If something changes, you update the dode only once inside the function
Easier to reuse
	call the same function multiple times without repeating logic
Easier to debug
	probles are easier to find in samll, isolated blocks

-----	
def calculate_sample(a,b):
    return (a * b) / 5 +( b -a)
    
print(calculate_sample(10,20))    

---
def gree_user():
    print("Hello There")
    
gree_user()    


def gree_user(name):
    print("Hello" + name)
    
gree_user("Tim")

What are arguments?
Function arguments enable developers to pass values to a function. For example, a function that is called set Colorcould include a string for the color that is being passed. Such a call would appear as setColor(“red”).

All functions must return a value
False.

How do you call a function?
You use the name of the function and then its argument in parentheses (which might be empty). 
For example: setColor(“red”),clearScreen()

Why do you use functions?
Functions enable developers to use the same code many times without retyping the statements.

Name one built-in function in Python?
One of the most commonly used built-in functions is print.
