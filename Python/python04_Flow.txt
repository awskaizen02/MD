Flow Control:

You will learn how to:
	•Describe the purpose and use of flow control in a program
	•Use conditional statements to run code based on evaluated criteria
	•Use loops to run code repeatedly until the criteria are met
	•Use the input() function to prompt users for input to be used when they run the program
	
	
Flow control is the order that individual statements, instructions, or function calls of an imperative program are run or evaluated

Control refers to the order that the interpreter runs the code.
Different statements can control this order.
Sometimes,you want something to happen when a condition is met. 
Then, you useconditional statements

If: The keyword if means that if this condition is met, complete this action.

Elif: The keword elif is short for else if. 

Else, if this condition is true, complete this other action. (You can have multiple elifstatements in a single block.)
Else: The keyword elsemeans that if none of the above conditions are met, complete this action


---------------------
Conditional statements: Examples

	If the time is between these hours, the store is open. Else, the store is closed.
	
	If the gas in the gas tank is belowa certain level, turn on the low fuel warning.
	
	If an employee has their badge, allow them into the building. Else, the door is locked. 
	
	If someone’s age is greater than 18, consider them to be an adult. Else, if their age is between 13 and 18, consider them to be a teen. Else, consider them a child.

age = 15

if age > 18:
    print("you are an adult")
elif age >= 13:
    print("your are teen")
else:
    print("you are child")

conditionals.py

num=2

if num > 5:
    print(" have a bunch of bananas")
elif num >= 1 and num <=4:
    print("I have a small bunch of bananas")
else:
    print("I have no bananas")


---------------------
Loops

	•Loops are a technique that tells Python to run a block of code repeatedly. 
	•Python runs loops for a certain number of times, or whilea certain condition is true.
	•The two types of Python loops are called for and while.

Whileloops	
	•Whileloops can run indefinitely, so you must include the condition for the loop to stop. 
	Otherwise, the code creates an infinite loop.
	•It is common to use an iterative counter with loops. 
	As the loop completes, the counter increases (or decreases). When the counter reaches a specific number, the loop stops	

count =5

while count <= 5:
    print("I love python")
    
    count +=1
	
	
---------------------

A forloop reads: 
	for each element in <thing>,do a certain task.
	•Some real-life examples are:
		For every egg in a recipe, add 2 cups of flour.
		For every package on our truck, add 2 kilograms
		For every hamburger that is ordered, subtract 1 from the inventory

•Forloops and lists work well together. 
•For every item in this list, Python prints that item. 
	–Every time it calls num, it assigns a value from the list (1, then 2, . . . ) to num. 
	–The loop then prints the value. 
	–After it goes through the entire list of values, the loop stops.
	
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)
    
---------------------


•Lists are a mutable data type. Lists can contain multiple data types (strings, ints, floats, and even other lists).
•Lists are denoted with brackets ([ ]) on each end.
•Values are enclosed in brackets, and they are separated with commas.
•Any number of items can be in a list—even zero (no) items.

y = [1,'a',2.2,'apple']
print(type(y))


---------------------

•Dictionaries contain immutable keys, which are associated to their values. 
Keys must be immutable data types.
•Dictionaries can be nested inside each other.
•To create an empty dictionary, use a pair of braces with nothing inside: {}
•Keys are separated from their values with a colon: {"Key":"Value"}
•Retrieve a value in the dictionary by its key:   myDict.get("key") or myDict["key"]

dict1 = {"ID": '1','Name':"Tim"}
print(dict1['ID'])
print(dict1['Name'])

---------------------
•The input() function asks the user to enter text and saves the result to a variable.
•One optional argument is a prompt for the user, as a string.

name = input("Enter your name:")
print("Hello,", name)
