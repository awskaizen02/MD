You will learn how to:
	•Explain what Python is
	•List reasons for using Python
	•List examples of programs that can be used to write Python code
	•Compare Python to shell scripting
	•Recognize the purpose ofAWS Lambda
	
Python is a free, easy-to-learn, general-purpose programming language.

The interpreter enables fast exploratory programming.	
Dynamic typing makes it easy to write quick scripts. 
Python syntax is simple when it is compared to other languages.
Python can support object-oriented, structural, and functional programming styles. 

Another reason to use Python is that it works across platforms.
It works on macOS, Linux, Microsoft Windows, and otherplatforms.
Though Bash scripts can be powerful, they mostly run on GNU/Linux

Where can you write Python?
Python can be written in any text editor if you have the interpreter also installed. 
Many developers use special programs that are called integrated development environments (IDEs). 
IDEs help with finding syntax and exception errors.
Some examples of programs that are used to write Python code include:
	Python(x,y)
	PyCharm
	Vim
	Eclipse
	Notepad++
	Spyder
	Microsoft Visual Studio Code
	
The following core capabilities are associated with IDEs:
•Syntax highlighting –Highlights keywords within the programming language
•Code completion –Similar to automatic completion for natural languages on modern cellular phones
•Debugging –Enables line-by-line inspection of the code while it is running with breakpoint capabilities
•Version control –Integrates popular version control systems, such as git and subversion	

Declaration of functions, classes, and imports have similar color.
•Comments are colored green.
•All syntax highlighting is customizable.
	Using an IDE: Syntax highlighting

•Functions are portrayed differently in a selection.
•Functions include arguments that are available

•Step through code line by line.
•Inspect variables as you step.
•Change values as you inspect


After you finish writing an application in Python, you can:
•Run the application from the command line: $python myPythonapp.py
•Run it from inside the IDE However, what if you must run your code or application? 
For example:
	1.Make it available to users around the world
	2.Handle millions of users
	
AWS Lambda
	•Upload your code to AWS Lambda.
	•Set up your code to trigger from an event, such as a user who is visiting your webpage.
	•Lambda runs your code only when it is triggered, and it uses only the compute resources that are needed.
	•You pay only for the compute time that you use.
	•Multiple languages are supported

Other tools: Shell scripting
	Shell scripting commands are run directly from the command line of an operating system. 
	They are available on any machine and on any operating system without the needto install new software.
	Different environments require different syntax or types of shell scripting,such as Bashand Zshell
	
Shell scripting versus Python
	•Shell scripting can be apowerful tool for system administration and command-line work, but it can be challenging when you want to use more complicated data structures. 
	•For example: Python can performsome actions—such as creating an HTTP server—in a single line.
	However, it could require many lines of code to do the same action in Bash.
	•Python has many external libraries and resources. It is a complete programming language.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will learn how to:
	•Install Python on a Linux computer
	•Define basic Python terminology
	•Declare variables in a Python script and perform operations on those variables
	•Explain statements, functions, and exceptions


Python uses indentation and spacing to group blocks of code together.
	•If you get runtime errors, check your spacing first.
	•Next, check your indentation for any missing punctuation, such as colons. 
Python is also case sensitive. Capitalization matters.

Identifiers
In Python, identifieris the name for entities like class, functions, and variables. 
It helps differentiate one entity from another entity.
When you name objects in Python, you must observe some rules:
	An identifier cannot start with a digit. 
	1variableis invalid, but variable1is valid.
	Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
	You cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, and % in your identifiers.
Identifiers can be any length.

File extensions: .py files The extension .py is a script file extension that is used in Python.
Files with the .py extension can be created in any text editor, but they need a Python interpreter to be run.

Functions:
	•A function tells the computer to do a specific task.
	•Functions have a name and are invoked by adding parentheses after the name.
	•Many functions take arguments, which are information that the function uses to do its specific task.
	•One useful function is the printfunction.
	•You can write your own functions. 
	•Python also has native functions (such as print) that are already built in
	
The text editor that you will use is Vim (Vi improved).
•To open it on the command line, enter vim <file name> or vim
•Vim opens in normal mode. To write to Vim, enter i (thei stands for insert)
•To get back to normal mode, press ESC
•When you are in normal mode, you can save and quit, or continue editing
•To save a file, enter :w <file name> or :w(the wstands for write)
•To close Vim, enter :q(the qstands for quit)
•To save and close, enter :wq	

------
vi helloworld.py

# This is my first pythion script

print("Hello, World")

esc
:wq


python helloworld.py

------
Comments:
	•Comments are notes to yourself and to other developers.
	•Comments describe the contents of a program and how it works so that a person who reviews the source code can understand it.
	•Use the pound (#) symbol to start writing a comment.
	•By starting a line of text with #, you tell the interpreter notto run this line as code
	
	# ''' or """
	'''
	this is muliple
	comment
	for testing
	'''
	"""
	this is muliple
	comment
	for testing
	"""
	
Data types determine what kind of data is stored in an object. 
Python stores the type of an object with the object. 
When the operation is performed, it checks whether that operation makes sense for that object. 
(This technique is called dynamic typing.)Example: Some functions or methods in Python expect a certain data type.
You cannot pass a string into a function that is expecting a float.
	
Integer (int):
	A whole number. Can be negative. 
		4 ,3000,–29

Float:
	A number that contains a decimal. Can also be negative
		Examples: 3.390 ,8.090,–0.001
		
Boolean (bool):
	A condition of True or False.
		Capitalization matters
		
String (str):
	A set of characters that are enclosed in quotation marks(" "or ' 'or ''''''). 
	Can include numbers,letters,and special characters.
		Examples: 
			"I am a string"
			'23456'
			'''I have 56 sheep'''
	Note:Numbers inside a string are still a string. 
	Python does not consider them to be integers or floats.	
	

Data types: Mutable versusimmutable 
	Mutable means changeable. In Python, some data types are mutable, and others are immutable

Mutable	
	•List 
	•Set
	•Dictionary
	•Byte array
	
immutable
	•Integers, floats, complex
	•Strings
	•Tuples
	•Frozen sets
------------------
x = 2
print(x)
print(type(x))

x = 'Hello world'
print(x)
print(type(x))

y = [1,2,3]
print(y)
print(type(y))

a1 = -12
print(a1)
print(type(a1))

a2 = 15.09
print(a2)
print(type(a2))


a3 = 1 + 3j
print(a3)
print(type(a3))

a4 = ''' hello
     world '''
print(a4)     

a5 = 'Tims\'s Commands'
print(a5)

a5 = 'Tim\'s \n Commands'
print(a5)

a5 = 'Tim\'s \t Commands'
print(a5)

a5 = 'Tim\'s  Commands \r tom'
print(a5)


x = [1,2,3]
print(type(x))

y = [1,'a',2.2,'apple']
print(type(y))

x = (1,2,3)
print(type(x))

y = (1,'a',2.2,'apple')
print(type(y))

list1 = [ 'banana','grape','watermelon','orange','passionfruit','cherry']
print(list1)
print(list1[0])

print(list1[0:3])

print(list1[1:])

print(list1)
list1.append('dragon fruit')
print(list1)

print(list1)
list1.insert(1,'kiwi')
print(list1)

print(list1)
list1.remove('grape')
print(list1)

tuple1 = ('banana','grape','watermelon','orange',)
print(tuple1)

set1 = {68,54,23,20,20,1,3,3,3}
print(set1)
list2 = [68,54,23,20,20,1,3,3,3]
print(list2)

y = set(list2)
print(y)

dict1 = {"ID": '1','Name':"Tim"}
print(dict1['ID'])
print(dict1['Name'])

---------------
Converting data types Python has specific commands that you can use to change an object from one data type to another.
•float(): In the example, 4 is assigned to the variable x. 
By its nature, 4 is an integer. However, x must be identified as a float, so the float() command was used. 
The result is 4.0.
•int(): By passing x back into the int(x)command, it receives 4 back. This command truncates the decimals. 

•Note: Using int()is not the same as rounding. 
It only removes any decimal digits that the number has.
It does not round the decimal numbers up or down, so be careful.
Lists, sets, tuples, and other data types will be covered later.

	a = 4.9
	print(a)
	print(type(a))
	
	
	b =(a)
	print(b)
	print(type(b))

	print(int(a))
	
--------
•Strings contain text, which can be a single character or paragraphs of text.
•Strings are characters that are enclosed between quotation marks. 
•Strings can contain numbers.
•Three ways of notating a string are: 
	–Single quotation marks (' ')
	–Double quotation marks (" ")
	–Triple quotation marks (''' ''')
	
The triple quote notation allows a string to span multiple lines and include non-printable formatting characters such as Newline and Tab

•Strings are immutable. 
	When you manipulate them, you create a new string. 
•You can concatenateor add strings together, which creates a new string.
•It is possible to create an empty string.
	–Example: x = ""
	
Note: If you want a space between the words of your new string, you must add it into one of the original strings. Otherwise, Python adds them as -is, without inserting a space.

-----------------
•This simple Python program adds the numbers 1and 1together.
•The result is 2, as displayed on the following line.
•The angle brackets (>>>) are not part of the program. The Python interpreter displays them
>>> 1 +1
2

•In this example, x is a variable that holds the number 1.
•When you do something with variables, Python looks up the values to understand what to do.
>>> x = 1
>>> x +x
2
----------------
•You can have as many variables as you want.
•You can name your variables whatever you want, within certain restrictions.
•Restrictions are:
	–A variable name can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores ( _ ). 
	–A variable name cannot begin with a number.
	–A variable name cannot be a keyword in Python.


Arithmetic operators			+, -,*,/, %, **, //
Comparison (relational) operators	<, >,<=,>=,==, !=
Assignment operators			=,+=,-=,*=,/=, %=, //=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<= 
Logical operators			and, or, not
Membership operators			in, not in
Identity operators			is, is not

Python also has bitwise operators that allow the manipulation of a number at the bit level
---------------------

Arithmetic operators:

x = 15
y = 4

print(x + y)
print(x - y)
print(x * y)
print(x / y)
print(x % y)
print(x ** y)
print(x // y)

---------------------
•An exception raises an error.
•Examples include:
	–Referencing a variable by the incorrect name
	–Dividing a number by zero
	–Trying to read a file that does not exist on your computer
•Exceptions result in a stack trace, which is a listing of the various ways that something went wrong.

print(x)
10 /0
"5" +2
int("abc")

>>> 10 /0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<python-input-4>", line 1, in <module>
    10 /0
    ~~~^~
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
>>> "5" +2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<python-input-5>", line 1, in <module>
    "5" +2
    ~~~~^~
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
>>> int("abc")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<python-input-6>", line 1, in <module>
    int("abc")
    ~~~^^^^^^^
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'
---------------------
The plus equals (+=) operator adds the rvalue(the value to the right of the operator) to the lvalue(the value to the left of the operator). The lvalue is usually a variable. For example, if xis 5, consider the following code: x+=10After that code is run, the value of xis 15

x =5
x +=10
print(x)
