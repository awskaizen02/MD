At the core of the lesson You will learn how to:

•Define programming
•Explain the function and features of an integrated development environment (IDE)
•Describe the cycle of programming

programming is the process of iving instructions to a computer, so it can perfom specific task

A purpose for programming: Automation

Automation refers to any technology that removes human interaction from a system, equipment, or process.
Scripts are often written to automate labor-intensive tasks and streamline workflows.
Before you automate a process, consider the following:

How much automation is needed to achieve your goals?
Identify the proper processes to automate.
Find the balance between over-automation and under-automation.
Don’t automate a bad process.

A programming language is a set of instructions and rules that allow humans to communicate with computers

Perform calculations.
Analyze some text.
Read and write files.
Display an image on the screen.
Accept input from the user.

•Many different languages exist
•Each language has its own:
	–Grammar and syntax
	–Common uses
	–Community

javascript = mainly used for websites and webapps
c++        = powerful and fast , used for games an systes software
java       = used for web and mobile application
python     = easy automation scrpting, web development, data analysis & visalization , ai &Ml

Software is written by using text files.
Software is written by using a computer language.

•Some text editors *include features that help programmers write code.

	
•Examples: 
	–Microsoft Visual Studio Code
	–Sublime Text
	–Vi or Vim
	–nano
	–GNU emacs
	–Notepad++
	–TextEdit

Integrated development environment (IDE)
	An IDE can tell you which words are spelled incorrectly, which phrases are unclear, and syntax that you wrote incorrectly.
	Most IDEs will suggest a fix for the issue.
	Some IDEs work with only one language, such as PyCharm for Python. 
	It will not show syntax errors for Java or C# to you.


Compilers and interpreters take the high-level language that you are developing in, and turn it into low-level machine code.

Compilers do this process all at one time after changes are made, but before it runs the code.

Interpreters do this process one step at a time while the code is running

Compiled languages
	•C/C++
	•Basic
	•GoLang (the language that Google developed)

Interpreted languages
	•Python
	•Ruby
	•JavaScript
	
JavaScript is interpreted when it is loaded into a webpage.
Java is compiled before the program runs on a computer	

Categorize a value as a data type

You will learn how to:
•Define the term data type
•Correctly match data types to data
•Assign values to variables and variables to data types



Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType


Example						Data Type	
x = "Hello World"				str	
x = 20						int	
x = 20.5					float	
x = 1j						complex	
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]		list	
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")		tuple	
x = range(6)					range	
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}		dict	
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}		set	
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})	frozenset	
x = True					bool	
x = b"Hello"					bytes	
x = bytearray(5)				bytearray	
x = memoryview(bytes(5))			memoryview	
x = None					NoneType


In memory
•In memory, everything consists of 0s and 1s.
•Data typing tells the computer how to:
	–Encode a data value into memory
	–Decode a data value out of memory
	
	
	What is a variable?
	
A variable is lke a container that stores data or informatation in a program

•A variable is an identifier in your code that represents a value in memory.
•The variable name helps humans to remember what the value means.

Assigning a variable to a value
	•Nearly all languages have an assignment operator.
	•Most languages use the equal sign (=)
	
		Course="AWS"
		Class="Morning"
		
American Standards Association for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a system that associates encoding characters into computers.
Use the ASCII table at ASCII Table to decipher the following message	

What is a composite data type?


Until now, you have used primitive data types. 

Primitive data type
	•Data types that are built into a coding language with no modification

Composite data type	
	•Combines multiple data types into a single unit
	(also called a collection or complex data type)

All modern programming languages have a way to create composite data types


	
Each movie could be described with:
•A name(data type would be a string)							# string
•A yearthat it was released (data type would be a number, or integer)			# integer
•A flag to indicate whether you have seen it or not (data type would be a Boolean)	# boolean

why use composite data types?
	the organize and group related data
	to make dataeasier to manage and process
	to handle collections of items in loops and functions
	
Functions:
	A function is a block of code that performs a specific task
	you can defin it once and reuseit whenever required
	
	* Avoid repatin code
	* Organize your program into smaller, easy-to-understand parts
	* reuse logic anywahere in your program
	* debug and maintain code more easily
	
array:
	A collection (or arry) is a group of multiple values stored togther i once variables
	
	num1 = 10
	num2 = 20
	num3 = 30
	
	numbers = [10, 20, 30]
	
	numbers = [10,20,30,40,50,60]
	print(numbers)
	print(numbers[0])
	print(numbers[-1])

The table shows a basic array of ages. Each age is assigned a slot, is of the same data type, and is adjacent to the previous age and the next age in memory.
Example collection: Array
•The first slot is almost always 0 in every language.
•Notice that the values do not need to be in any order.

List:
a list in python is collection used to store mltiple items in a single variable
A Python List is an ordered collection of items.
	•Each item can be of a different data type.
	•Items can be accessed using an index.
	•Items can have duplicate values.
	
	numbers = [10,20,30,40,50,60,"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
	num2=len(numbers)
	print(num2)
	
What does execution pathmean?

•The sequence of steps that the program performs when it runs
•The program might ...
	–Come to an either-or choice
	–Come to multiple choices
	–Perform work on each item in a loop
•The programmer must be able to predict what those steps will be...
	–When they write the code initially
	–When they debug problems that they encounter	
	
A program flow refers to the sequence of stpes or instructions that a program follows whe it runs
	when a program is executed, the computer follows these steps in order, unless specific conditions change that flow(like choices or loops)
	
** Sequence:
	the program runs statments on after another , from top to bottom
	
	print("start")
	print("Processing")
	print("End")
	
** Selection (Decision-making)
	The program can make choice based on condition
	* Either-or choice(if / else)
	
age = 18
if age >= 18:
	print("You can able to vote")
else:
	print("You are not bale to vote this year)
	
** Multiple chose (if/elif/else)

grade = 85
if grade >= 90:
	print("A")
elif grade >= 75:
	print("B")	
else:
	print("C")	
	
	** Looping
the program can repeat actions for each items or until a condition is met

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
